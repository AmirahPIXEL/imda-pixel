Find opportunities to mix with, learn from and get inspired by each other to create customer-centric digital experiences.<br> Companies and creators can look forward to being part of a unique, multi-disciplinary community of tech innovators, content creators, digital designers and game developers in PIXEL.<br>
PIXEL hosts themed events, workshops and masterclasses that purposefully bring together a combination of tech X media X design for customer-centric innovation. For example, we regularly conduct design thinking workshop and UI/UX clinics for tech companies to incorporate design principles into their digital products. We support content creation projects using digital techniques and immersive technology.

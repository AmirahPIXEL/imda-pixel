PIXEL-appointed mentors are trusted and experienced advisors who are willing to take time from their busy schedules to coach and guide promising infocomm and media (ICM) companies on their innovation projects or business growth plans. PIXEL will facilitate the matching of mentors to mentees based on the expertise of mentors and the needs of mentees, and provide the space for mentoring sessions.

Mentors and mentees are expected to develop and mutually agree on the scope and objectives of their engagement when they are matched. There is no cost for a company in PIXEL Community to be mentored.

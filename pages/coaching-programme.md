# Project-based Coaching Programme 

For Project-based coaching, PIXEL will connect your company with a consultant on our panel, to deliver on an agreed Design Thinking/UI-UX/ Digital Storytellng project scope, and build capabilities within your team. This Project-based coaching programme is for Singapore-based Tech & Media Start-ups, SMEs and Large Local Enterprises. Approved projects will be supported up to 70% of the total cost, capped at $70,000. It supports projects that may require up to 12 man-days of consultant engagement, for up to 6 months. 

You can apply through a 3-step application process: (i) Share an Executive Summary of the project with us via this [link](https://go.gov.sg/pbcstandard); (ii) Meet with us/the consultant to scope deliverables & duration; and (iii) Submit an Application Form and commence project when approved. 

All projects will be evaluated based on its innovation, scalability, the commitment to project (team, funding, relevance to core business), and capability building it brings to the organisation.
